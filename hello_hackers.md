# HELLO HACKERS üßë‚Äçüíª
This is the first module that I tried my hand at. Overall, it was a pretty intuitive and simple module with no such mind-crunching tasks. Details about the challenges are as follows:
## Intro to Commands
  In this challenge the main task was to get familiarized with using simple, non-argument, commands in the Linux (bash) command line. We were asked to use the ```hello``` command, which 
  returned the flag `86KB7nvKScDOwBWK29YND3Yv6_y.ddjNyUDL0UTN0czW`
  An issue that I faced here, was how to copy from the Web VSCode terminal, since `Ctrl+C` would simply terminate the ongoing command. I found out that by using `Ctrl+left-mouse-button`, it would
  send the flag into the search box with the entirety of it selected. From there, I simply copied it.

 ## Intro to Arguements
  After completing the previous challenge, this one was quite simple to execute. All that the problem required, was to execute the ```hello hackers``` command, which returned the flag 
  `A9mOwzkkYBt1aR_lD8RePPXZxb6.dhjNyUDL0UTN0czW`. The only difference between this one, and the previous one, was the usage of an argument with the command.
