# PONDERING PATHS üõ£Ô∏è
The second module of the Linux Luminarium. Here, the basic control and handling of the *tree* filesystem has been taught. Details about the challenges are as follows:
## The Root
In this challenge, the objective was to locate the program `pwn` via the changing the directory using `/`. A simple implementation of ```/pwn``` yielded in successful capturing of the flag
`0aDK2jPBH3rcTPnFpKRleGTCOTA.dhzN5QDL0UTN0czW`. Pretty straightforward, so far, not much to think about.

## Program and Absolute Paths
This one took me a couple of tries to get it correct. The semantics threw me off, somewhat. Going through the problem statements multiple times helped me understand that the task was to simply run a program via the 
absolute path of the file `run` through the directory `challenge` which is in the root directory `/`. In short, the command ```/challenge/run``` led me to the flag `AWCmMkn4jGYXHugepb1nKMJRaKC.dVDN1QDL0UTN0czW`

## Position thy self
Here, the objective was to, again, run a program `run` from the `challenge` directory. However, unlike earlier, we do not start from the root `/` directory. The starting directory is `position-thy-self/`. From here, I used the **c**hange **d**irectory command (cd) to go back to the root directory. The exact commands were ```cd /``` followed by ```/challenge/run```, which led me to the flag `AAj54A3AJ0P2ApvlSVoar1yVguz.dZDN1QDL0UTN0czW`
